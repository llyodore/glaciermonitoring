in Patagonia that is not retreating from the relentless 
assault of climate change. With an area of about 250 
km2
, it has remained stable for decades.
The second, 60 kilometers further north, is one of 
the glaciers most affected by rising temperatures, 
struggling against the elements. With a total area 
of 870km2

for monitoring glaciers.&nbsp;</h3>
        <h6 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> This section will give a quick overview of the use of 
sensing for glacier monitoring. </h6>
        <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">A. Work done on glacier monitoring</h4>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4"> The use of satellite imagery has multiple advantages 
when it comes to glaciology. The main ones are 
the multispectral and multitemporal capabilities of 
the imagery, which are of unparalleled support for 
glacier mapping and monitoring, with the advantage 
of synoptic view over a large area (Hubbard &amp; 
Glasser 2005). Thus, in many remote areas such as 
Antarctica and the Himalayas, numerous inventory 
studies have been carried out. In Antarctica, for 
example, the monitoring of glaciers and the ice cap is 
crucial. Its melting will lead to a rise in sea levels that 
could prove catastrophic. Thus, as Baumhoer et al. 
(2018)1
 point out in their paper on Antarctic glaciers, 
satellite tracking can highlight dynamics of retreat of 
a large part of the ice sheet during certain periods. 
In the Himalayas, the process remains the same: 
using remote sensing to monitor retreating glaciers. 
For Kumar et al. (2019)2
, who studied glaciers in the 
Bhutan High Himalayan, the use of these monitoring 
techniques allows the characterization of changes 
over a period from 1978 to 2017. </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-5">Closer to home in 
Europe, Rabatel et al. (2002)3
 used remote sensing to 
conduct glacier mass monitoring on the Mont Blanc 
glacier in the French Alps. <br>In short, remote sensing makes it possible to measure 
the spatial dynamics of glaciers. This makes it possible 
to evaluate the loss or gain of glacier territory 
over a more or less significant period (between 15 
and 30 years). As climatic phenomena take place 
over a long period of time, it is often preferable to 
take a relatively long time span for a given glacier 
in order to determine variations in the spatial 
coverage of the glacier, glacier movements and the 
physical evolution of the glacier object itself. Some 
work carried out in France for mountain glaciers in 
temperate zones has shown the relevance of using 
high-resolution images. Fallourd (2012)4
 has carried 
out a thesis on the monitoring of alpine glaciers, 
which demonstrates the potential of SAR images for 
measuring the surface displacement of glaciers.

        <h4 class="u-align-center u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> B. Perito Moreno and Upsala Glacier in the 
scientific literature</h4>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">These two glaciers have been monitored in recent 
years. Thus, Lenzano et al. (2018)5
 proposed a follow&nbsp;up of the Perito Moreno using...cameras left at 
strategic locations for months. This monitoring made 
it possible to study the variations, minimal from a 
satellite point of view, that this glacier faces in terms 
of its ice front. Another study, published in 2015 by 
Minowa et al.
, focuses on the difference between the 
Perito Moreno and the Ameghino Glacier, which we 
will come back to briefly later. Once again, this study 
focuses on the retreat of the Ameghino Glacier, which 
is located 3 km further north of the Perito Moreno, 
but which has experienced a significant retreat of its 
ice front and his surface elevation. (Figure 2)<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">As for the Upsala Glacier, its retreat is unfortunately 
well known. For example, Skvarca et al. (2003)6
study the rapid melting of this glacier by studying 
the inter-seasonal variation, which is estimated 
to be around 400 m. The glacier was subject to an 
almost continuous recession from the end of 1978 
until 1999, with periodic slowdowns. However, this 
study mentions that the change has been more at 
the western edge of the glacier. Since 1999, both 
recession and advance movements have been 
observed. In another study by Moragues et al. 
(2018)7
, they study the velocity of the glacier using 
different imaging techniques to study the areas 
that are moving the most. Other papers talk about&nbsp;the Patagonian ice field in a broader way, such as 
the paper by Foresta et al. (2018)8
, studying the 
variations in this large area.</p>

study</p>
        <h4 class="u-text u-text-3"> A. Method</h4>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4">In order to deal with our subject, we chose to use 
images from the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites. 
The advantage of this satellite, apart from its 30m 
resolution in almost all its bands, is precisely its long 
period of service, which allows it to be used as far 
back as the 1970s. Its regular returns, its quality and 
its number of spectral bands covering the visible, 
infrared and thermal bands make it a preferred 
choice for a temporal study. In addition, its coverage 
is large, extending over 170x170km. </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-5">We were unable to obtain images from January due to cloud cover. The 
2001 image has only 3% cloud cover, with a quality 
similar to the previous one. 
Finally, a last image dated 4 February 2017 
is used. The cloud cover is 6.18%, the image 
quality is also similar. No more recent images 
will follow, mainly because of the cloud cover.
All these images were then radiometrically 
processed to correct for atmospheric disturbances 
in the images, using the metadata files provided. 
Next, the bands had to be stacked into a new raster 
and then came the clipping stage to match the two 
glaciers. The cut-out area was defined on the basis 
of the 1985 satellite image: we assumed that the 
glaciers were retreating and that a certain amount 
of security was therefore needed to study their 
evolution. Then came the stage of classifying them.</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6">This study will 
only use the visible and infrared bands. 
Three images were therefore selected for 
processing (although more were downloaded and 
radiometrically corrected) at a similar time of the 
year in order to make a comparison. The choice 
was therefore made for the summer period in the 
southern hemisphere, when the glacier is at its 
minimum. A first image dating from 27 January 1985 
was selected. This image contains 35% cloud cover 
(but does not cover the desired areas), and an image 
quality of 9. It has the advantage, like the others that 
will follow, of covering the two study sites in a single 
file (see Annex 1 for all images). 
The second selected image was acquired on 12 
March 2001, 16 years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">B. The Object Oriented Approach</h4>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">A total of 6 images were selected. The choice was 
made to use the object-oriented classification 
method, using 4 dominant classes: rock/bare ground, 
ice, snow and finally water. This simplification comes 
from the very purpose of the project: it is to have a 
follow-up of the glacier, and it would therefore be 
useless to clutter the image with too much spurious 
information.The classification was done in Qgis, with 
the OTB plugin. After segmentation, all the models 
received a Kappa index greater than 0.9 in their 
training phase. The results were satisfactory, and a 
manual correction was carried out in order to give 
the final classification a high degree of fidelity with 
respect to the original image.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">The results obtained speak for themselves: zone 1 
was reconstructed in a very faithful manner (Figure 3 
and annex 2). The glacier tongue, which extends into 
the waters of Lake Argentino, shows a quasi-static 
form in the temporal evolution of the classifications. 
The valley in which it evolves is perfectly delineated. 
Zone 2 offers us a similar rendering: the glacier 
flowing into the cold waters of the lake offers an 
extremely precise ice front. Various lakes form on 
the eastern side of the glacier (Figure 4 and annex 2).<br>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">The glaciers in this study, although both present in 
the campo de hielo patagoâ€™nico sur, do not behave in 
the same way. 
The first, the Perito Moreno, is one of the few glaciers 
in Patagonia that is not retreating. It even advances 
by an average of 2 meters per day, but its calving 
(falling ice blocks) is regular, so it appears immobile 
on satellite images. This is the particularity of this 
glacier: no change is observed over the 32-year 
period we are studying. In fact, there is a balance 
between gain and loss of mass9
. As can be seen from 
the satellite images and the resulting classification, 
the only ice changes are from a nearby glacier. The 
Ameghino Glacier, which lies on the other side of the 
mountain north of the Perito Moreno, and which is 
fed by the same ice field, has seen a retreat of almost 
three kilometers over the same period. However, it is 
only five kilometers away from the latter.
In order to study the glacier dynamics of the area 
in more detail, you have to go 60 kilometers further 
north: here is the Uspala Glacier. Sadly known as 
an example of the melting of glaciers due to global 
warming, this glacier continues its inexorable retreat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4">In 32 years, it has lost almost 50 km2
 (see Figure 5).
Its ice front has retreated by 8.2 kilometers. It has 
goâ€‹ne from a 4.35 kilometer front in 1985 to a 3.21kilometer front in 2017, gradually curling up into

      <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-1">The loss of ice is clearly visible on the classifications 
and on satellite images. Also, we see a clear loss of 
surface area on the secondary glaciers that feed the 
main glacier: they are increasingly entrenched in the 
valleys. Thus, the main glacier (defined according to 
an area cut) will decrease from an area of 190 km2
 in 
1985 to an area of 124km2
 in 2017.
In order to support the classifications and the 
contribution of this method to the monitoring of 
these glaciers, other exploratory techniques have 
been implemented</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4">In order to establish the accuracy of the objectoriented classification, it was discussed using 
another method to display the ice and to carry out 
monitoring: the averaging of spectral bands. 
The technique involves, after segmentation of the 
raster image, calculating the band averages of these 
polygons. The band averages represent an average 
of the spectral signature of a single band over the&nbsp;different pixels that make up these geometries. It 
turns out that ice has a weaker spectral signature 
than snow: through classification, it is possible 
to display only those polygons whose signatures 
are those of ice and snow. </p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6">This approach allows a 
better understanding of the boundaries between&nbsp;snow and ice from a technical point of view, not an 
interpretative one. (Figure 7).
In our case, we decided to use spectral band 2, which 
is the blue band. Indeed, ice has the particularity of 
absorbing many spectral bands, in particular red. 
The reflected light therefore tends towards blue and 
turquoise. There are therefore very good results with 
this particular band. This approach has therefore been 
tested several times on images from 2017 and 1985 
in particular. The results, disappointing for the land 
and sea part, remain more than correct for the ice 
and snow part. In addition, the speed of the process 
and its reliability make it an ideal complement to the 
object-oriented approach, and even dethrone it for 
the ice part. 
As the results of the object-oriented approach are 
conclusive, we will propose here another parallel 
experimental method in order to compare our results 
with those obtained and to judge the relevance1
 of 
the semi-automatic classification.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">The protocol consists in differentiating the different 
forms of water (ice, snow and liquid) according 
to their specific physical and optical properties 
(characteristic spectral signatures).
The optical properties of a material influence the 
way optical radiation reacts when it strikes the 
surface. Each material has its own spectral signature 
that reflects the degree to which it reflects, absorbs 
and transmits at various wavelengths of received 
radiation.
The optical properties of the shape of the water 
directly influence how the optical radiation reacts 
when it strikes the surface. Thus, each shape has its 
own spectral signature. This signature corresponds to 
the degree of reflection, absorption and transmission 
at various wavelengths of the received radiation. All 
our study bodies are represented by the graph Figure

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-5">It can be seen that ice and water have a high 
reflection in the visible range (0.4-0.75 Âµm) and 
a lower reflection in the NIR (Near Infrared) (0.78 
to 0.9 Âµm), and a very low reflection in the Short 
Wave Infrared (SWIR) (1.57 to 1.78 Âµm) (Figure 9). 
Its low reflection is due to its liquid water content 
on a microscopic scale. The characteristic reflection 
index thus depends directly on the composition of 
the material itself2
.</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6">Here, we are first interested in the wavelength from 
0.52 to 0.60 Âµm (green feature) (Figure 10). The 
latter allows us to differentiate between liquid water 
and snow as well as ice.
In a second step, the range between 1.55 and 1.75 
Âµm (SWIR) allows us to visually differentiate water 
from snow and ice (Figures 11 and 12). </p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-7">1- As the object-oriented approach is based on sampling, the disparity of the values of the points contained within the 
samples has a great influence on the result.&nbsp;<br> 2-The index differs from the type of material (snow, ice, snow, etc.) but also depends on the period of observation (climatic 
parameters directly influencing the composition of the material)
