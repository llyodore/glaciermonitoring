        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-1">In the first, the Perito Moreno Glacier does not seem 
to be changing too much (Figure 13). There is a slight 
ablation of the end of one of its branches. 
On the other hand, the Uspala Glacier is retreating 
(Figure 14). This translates into a retreat of its ice and 
an increase in the mass of water that must correspond 
to the glacial lake that is forming and becoming more 
and more important (decrease in the mass of solid 
water and increase in its liquid mass).
In a second step, our protocol allowed us to obtain 
similar results to those obtained by the object-oriented approach (Annex 3): the main classes are 
identical on both methods. </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">Although the optical 
segregation approach brings small differences 
concerning the snow cover, this must be related to 
the difference in precision between the raster and&nbsp;the vector: the pixel representation seems to offer a 
higher level of detail than the shapefile. Moreover, 
a very fine deposit of snow by the wind is enough 
to make it stand out on the surface of the DSM. 
Snow on the surface (with a low pixel density, often 
resembling powder trails) is not a good indicator for 
tracking glacier movements (Annex 4).</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">The object-oriented approach and the protocol 
presented made a surface analysis of the NSM 
surface occupation possible. However, how to judge 
the real presence of features if they are covered 
by a thin film of snow? The surface of a glacier is 
never fixed. Numerous factors such as the wind 
(which moves and deposits snow) and temperature 
variations modify the physical state of the surface 
(solidification, fusion, etc.)(Annex 5).</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">NDSI Indicator 
The construction of the NDSI (Normalized Difference 
Snow Index)as a graphical indicator for the snow 
surface cover within each pixel is similar to the NDVI&nbsp;index4
. Snow has a high reflectance in the visible 
range (VIS) and a low reflectance in the shortwave 
infrared range (SWIR), its cover can be observed by 
the difference between these two reflectances.
In order to obtain a consistent indicator, the result 
must then be normalized. This is done by dividing the 
result by the sum of the two desired bands: 
NDSI = (VIS-SWIR)/(VIS+SWIR)
Thus, a pixel with an NDSI &gt;0.0 will be composed of 
snow. The closer the value is to 1, the greater the 
snow index (proportional to the signal quality). </p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-1">It can be seen that most of the two study areas 
are covered by snow. In both areas, there is also a 
decrease in snow cover in the year 2001 compared 
to 1985 (figure 15).
We cannot judge here if the decrease of snow cover 
is the result of a retreat of the two glaciers or of local 
climate change. 
However, the index’s knowledge reinforces our 
previous work by allowing a more detailed analysis 
of the land cover by the superficial snow layers as 
well as to identify the zones of accumulation of the 
glaciers (zones where the snow accumulates to form 
ice later on)(figure 16). From 1985 to 20015
, we can 
see a relatively stable recharge zone was observed 
within the Perito Moreno. This is located to the west 
of the photograph (see NDSI and BC)</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">In addition, the realization of this index also allows 
us to look at the albedo6
 of each of the two sites. 
Although albedo is an important measurement tool 
for predicting the movement of glaciers over the 
long term, its calculation is not very useful here: NDSI 
records the snow cover during the data acquisition 
time and does not allow us to characterize all the 
changes that may have taken place over the longer 
term. Thus, from these data, it is not possible to 
study the impact of surface reflection on the short 
and long term.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-5">6 The albedo corresponds to the reflectivity of a surface: it is the ratio of the reflected light flux to the incident light flux.</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6">7 Glacial mass balance: Glacial mass balance is the gain or loss of ice from a glacier. The mass balance is positive in areas 
of snow accumulation and negative in the ablation zone (where the glacier melts).</p>

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">A story about climate change.</h3>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">To sum up, glaciers are reliable climate indicators that 
continue to record various variations. At the same 
time, the development of remote sensing tools is 
making it possible to monitor them in an increasingly 
relevant way.<br>Glacier monitoring is now a major challenge. Glaciers 
account for 70% of the world’s drinking water. 
Chemical changes in the glacier can lead to a large 
number of natural disasters such as glacial floods, 
floods, etc. Moreover, glaciers are also considered to 
be excellent climate indicators: ice acts as a climate 
archive. Their composition is directly linked to the 
conditions in which they are formed. A glacier is 
thus a succession of ice stratification. Their study 
allows the long-term paleoclimatic reconstruction 
of the region. Our study has made it possible to 
monitor glaciers by remote sensing. The Objectoriented analysis was used to determine the surface 
composition of our two glaciers. This semi-automatic 
classification was supported by the implementation 
of a parallel method based on an assembly of 
characteristic spectral bands. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">Finally, the proposed 
construction of the NDSI index allowed us to better 
delimit the accumulation and ablation zones of our 
glaciers. Although our time scale is relatively short 
to characterize the evolution of a glacier, we can 
nevertheless observe a retreat of the Uspala glacier 
which would consequently seem to have a negative 
mass balance. On the other hand, the Perito Moreno 
shows very little variation. Its stability suggests a 
mass balance close to zero.</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4">Although progress in remote sensing is real (image 
resolution and availability of analysis tools), real 
glacier monitoring must nevertheless include in situ 
data collection. Glacier monitoring by remote sensing 
only allows the surface of the glacier to be analyzed. 
The internal structure such as its thickness or the 
composition of its transported material can only be 
obtained by coring. The estimation of the volume 
remains important because it allows the quantity of 
material available to be estimated (it is thus possible 
to carry out a mass balance). Moreover, certain 
physicochemical properties such as ice viscosity are 
not visible on satellite images. This study could thus 
serve as a first approach to the study of a follow-up 
of these two glaciers and could be completed by field 
data</p>
